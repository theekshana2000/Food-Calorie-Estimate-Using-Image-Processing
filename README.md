# Food-Calorie-Estimate-Using-Image-Processing
# Abstract
In the face of escalating obesity rates and related
non-communicable diseases globally, there is a critical need
for accurate dietary monitoring. This paper introduces a novel
method for food calorie estimation by integrating advanced
image processing with a suite of machine-learning algorithms.
Our approach employs a diverse array of models CNN, SVM,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes,
AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting Machines to enhance the
precision of food classification. The rigorous evaluation led to
the selection of the best-performing model, distinguished by
its ability to differentiate among various food types accurately.
Complementing the classification process, we utilized YOLO
v8 for object detection, achieving highly accurate identification
of individual food items in images. Central to this technique
is quantifying food volume and calorie content, grounded in
the innovative use of a coin as a reference object for scale
calibration in each image. This approach bridges the gap between
technological advancement and practical dietary assessment and
represents a significant contribution to public health initiatives
to combat diet-related health issues.
