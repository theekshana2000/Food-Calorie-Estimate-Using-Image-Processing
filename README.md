# Food-Calorie-Estimate-Using-Image-Processing
# Abstract
In the face of escalating obesity rates and related
non-communicable diseases globally, there is a critical need
for accurate dietary monitoring. This paper introduces a novel
method for food calorie estimation by integrating advanced
image processing with a suite of machine-learning algorithms.
Our approach employs a diverse array of models CNN, SVM,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes,
AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting Machines to enhance the
precision of food classification. The rigorous evaluation led to
the selection of the best-performing model, distinguished by
its ability to differentiate among various food types accurately.
Complementing the classification process, we utilized YOLO
v8 for object detection, achieving highly accurate identification
of individual food items in images. Central to this technique
is quantifying food volume and calorie content, grounded in
the innovative use of a coin as a reference object for scale
calibration in each image. This approach bridges the gap between
technological advancement and practical dietary assessment and
represents a significant contribution to public health initiatives
to combat diet-related health issues.

# INTRODUCTION
In the face of rising global health concerns like obesity and
diabetes, the way we understand and monitor dietary habits has
become increasingly crucial. Traditional methods, like food
diaries, often need to catch up due to reliance on personal
memory and inaccurate portion size estimation. Advances in
innovative technology, particularly in image processing and
machine learning has opened new avenues for more accurate
and efficient dietary assessment. These technologies automate
the identification of food items and estimation of portion sizes
from digital images, aiming to streamline dietary assessment
processes.
As smartphones with high-quality cameras become more
common and more accessible to obtain, and as image recognition and deep learning technologies improve, this method
of food assessment is becoming more practical. People can
get real-time feedback on their diet, which can help them
eat healthier and provide researchers with important nutrition
information. However, figuring out what food is and how many
calories are in an image is complex and complicated. The
systemâ€™s accuracy can be affected by lighting, how the food is
prepared, and any shape the food has. Also, many foods look
the same but have different nutritional values, making the task
more difficult.
Progress in technology is significant, especially for improving public health and nutrition science. It calls for continued
studying and progression in image processing, machine learning, and deep learning fields. Combining these technologies
with artificial intelligence (AI) changes industries, especially
healthcare, where AI engages assistants, increases online life
experience, and is helpful in predictive diagnosis. As a subset
of AI, Machine Learning (ML) uses reams of data to make
correct predictions and recommendations, thus leading to such
breakthroughs as spam filters, image analyzers, and selfdriving cars. Another tool of ML, deep learning, performs as
the human brain, but it is mainly successful in speech and
image recognition tasks.
This project aims to create a system that exploits all those
technological advancements to make calorie tracking easier,
more accurate, and more comprehensive. Existing calorie
counting apps, though at times may be helpful, face constraints
in accuracy and scope. The project aims to improve calorie
tracking by applying image processing technology to estimate
calories for a broader range of foods with a higher level of
accuracy. Yet, it is predicted that this progress will have a
tremendous impact on healthier lifestyles and evidence-based
dietary decisions worldwide.

# METHODOLOGY
Currently, most calorie-counting apps have difficulty finding the exact volume of food from an image. Therefore,
many problems are faced in measuring the calorie content
of food.Calories are calculated using ECUATFD, a data set
that provides volume and mass information. It also uses deep
learning and machine learning techniques to ensure accuracy.
The following conceptual framework visualizes the system
process. An image of food is given as input to the system,
and it categorizes the food, calculates volume and mass, and
counts calories.
The ECUSTFD dataset, developed by the East China University of Science and Technology, is
a comprehensive food dataset widely utilized in the field of
computer vision for food recognition tasks. This dataset is
particularly notable for its extensive collection of food images,
encompassing a diverse range of cuisines and dishes, captured
under various conditions to simulate real-world scenarios in
this dataset. There are 2978 photos overall. In this data
set is food. 19. Consists of apples, bananas, buns, donuts,
eggs, grapes, lemons, lychees, moon- cakes, mustard, oranges,
peaches, plums, kiwis, and tomatoes. The dataset contains a
set of images with a top view and a side view. The fact that
ECUSTFD includes a reference object ( one yuan coin ). The
mass and volume of each meal dish are also included in the
dataset.The ECUSTFD dataset is instrumental in developing
and benchmarking food recognition algorithms
